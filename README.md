Problem statements and solutions in ROR

Array - Sliding window - the two pointers usually move in the same direction will never overtake each other. This ensures that each 		value is only visited at most twice and the time complexity is still O(n).
		-> String(longest-substring-without-repeating-characters, min_window_substring), min_size_sub_array

		
		Two Pointers  - Two pointers is a more general version of sliding window where the pointers can cross each other and can be on different arrays
		-> String(valid_palindrome, palindromic_substring), Arrays (sort_colors, merge_sorted_array)
